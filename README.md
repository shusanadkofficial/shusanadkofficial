# WhoAmI
Hello, I am **Shusan Adhikari** currently studying Information Technology at Informatic College Pokhara affiliated under London Metropolitian University. I was never a brilliant student but I am working my way out and trying my best to learn everything I can. I really have nothing special to say about myself but I hope that changes very soon in future. Till then, **grind goes on**.
